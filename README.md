# unitConverter
## Project developed during my Programming course
### Objective:
### Suppose you are developing a library of routines to convert from one unit to another. Create an objective-c class called myConversion. Create fields named miles, kilometers, pounds, kilograms, inches, centimeters, US_dollars, CAN_dollars. Create a conversion method for each of the following:
###      miles to kilometers,
###      kilometers to miles,
###      kilograms to pounds,
###      pounds to kilograms,
###      inches to centimeters,
###      centimeters to inches,
###      us to canadian dollars,
###      canadian to us dollars
### Prompt the user for their conversion choice (by entering a number from 1-8) and then have them enter a number to be converted. Call the appropriate conversion ### method and store both values (the original and the converted value) in the appropriate variable.
